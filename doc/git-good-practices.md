# Git good practices

Here is a list of practices we currently use to manage the content of the quantum benchmark at our best. These recommendations are likely to evolve soon.

## Branches

If you are working on defining new content, we recommend creating branches with the specific name of the protocol you are working on.

## Commit messages

We try to keep commit messages concise and clear following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention with the following keywords:
- feat: defines a new feature or content added to the zoo
- feat-update: defines an update of existing content on the zoo
- fix: defines a technical fix (do not depend on the scientific content of the zoo)

You can find examples of messages in the [past commits](https://github.com/v-gilbert/quantumbenchmarkzoo/commits/master/).
