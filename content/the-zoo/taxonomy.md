## Metric

In a metric space, a metric $$D$$ is a function $$D: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ which measures the distance between points $$x$$ and $$y$$. 

For all $$x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$$, a metric must satisfy:
- Positivity: $$x \neq y \Rightarrow D(x, y) > 0$$ and $$D(x, y) = 0$$ if $$x=y$$
- Symmetry: $$D(x, y) = D(y, x)$$
- Triangle inequality: $$D(x, z) \leq D(x, y) + D(y, z)$$

## Quantum simulation

Execution of a quantum program on a real quantum computer.

## Quantum emulation

Emulation of a quantum computer with a classical method. Several classical methods are used to emulate a quantum computer:
- Classically solving the Shr√∂dinger equation
- Matrix diagonalization
- others ?
