# Single-qubit Clifford Randomized Benchmarking

## Motivations
- Create a protocol that is resistant to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors.
- Obtain a better scalability compared to process tomography.

##Â Protocol
- Each gate $$G_i$$ consist of a rotation pulse of the Clifford group combined with a rotation pulse $$P_i$$ that depolarize the noise (under markovian assumption).
- The invertion gate $$R$$ is efficiently computed from the sequence {% cite gottesman1997stabilizer %} to get an eigenstate of the measurement basis.
- The success metric is the probability of observing the final determinist state. It is estimated for different lengths $$l$$ and used to fit the exponential decay function.

## Limitations
- This protocol can only benchmark a single qubit.
- This protocol is only using gates from the Clifford group.
