# Direct Randomized Benchmarking

## Motivations 
Direct Randomized Benchmarking (DRB) was proposed by T. Proctor et al. in 2019 {% cite proctor2019direct %} to circumvent several limits of the <a href="{{ multi-qubit-CRB.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">multi-qubit CRB</a> protocol. As the multi-qubit CRB protocol strongly depends on the compilation of the Clifford group into single and two-qubit gates, with circuit depth scaling as $$O(n^2 / \log(n))$$ for benchmarking $$n$$ qubits, the authors observe that the multi-qubit CRB protocol has not been used to benchmark more than three qubits in practice. DRB is instead intended to directly benchmark the fidelity of native gates in a quantum device, avoiding the costly compilation step. A subsequent study by A. Polloreno et al. developed the theory behind the DRB protocol {% cite polloreno2023theory %}.

## Protocol
The protocol is used to benchmark $$n$$ qubits. At first, a random $$n$$-qubit stabilizer state is created to form the initial state $$\rho_0$$ with the unitary $$U_\mathrm{stab}$$. Each layer of gate $$g_i$$ is drawn from a probability distribution $$\mu$$ specified by the user (for example, one could be $$1/4$$ probability of having a single CNOT, with the rest consisting of random single-qubit rotations). The only restriction on the distribution $$\mu$$ is that it should generate a group of gates that can generate the Clifford group $$\mathbb{C}_n$$ (generalized after to unitary-2-design). The ending gate $$g_\mathrm{end}$$ projects the quantum state into a random computational basis state so that the final measurement is deterministic (i.e., it measures the sequence's success or failure). The final measured bitstring $$b$$ defines if the computation is a success or failure and requires being computed classically beforehand. The success probability permits reconstructing the average error rate of a single layer of random gates. As the success probability may strongly depend on the distribution $$\mu$$ and on the compiler, this information should be reported together carefully.

## Assumptions
- This protocol assumes that the noise model is Markovian, meaning that the noise of a gate does not depend on the sequence of previous gates (history-independent).
- The average error of all gates is depolarizing.
- The sampled average fidelity of the random sequences must quickly converge to the average for all possible sequences, as only a small fraction of all possible sequences is being implemented.

## Limitations 
- Even if the quantum circuit generated by the DRB protocol will be in general shorter than the circuit generated by the multi-qubit CRB protocol, the stabilizer initialization and measurement still require a depth of single and two-qubit gates that scale as $$O \left(n^2 / \log(n) \right)$$.
- The protocol is not scalable for all types of gate groups as it requires emulating the output of the quantum circuit to define the bitstring $$b$$. However, for groups that only contain Clifford gates, the emulation of the output is efficiently done classically.
- The error rate being measured is slightly overestimated due to the noisy preparation of the $$n$$-qubit stabilizer state (see end of DRB theory section of {% cite proctor2019direct %}).

## Implementation
