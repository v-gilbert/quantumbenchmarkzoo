# Multi-qubit Clifford Randomized Benchmarking

## Motivations

- Extend the single-qubit RB to multi-qubit clifford group $$C_n$$.

##Â Protocol

- For each sequence length, Clifford gates are uniformely and efficiently sampled from $$C_n$$ {% cite Koenig2014 %}. The depth of the quantum circuit associated to each $$C_n$$ grows as $$O(n^2 / \log(n))$$.
- The invertion unitary $$R$$ is efficiently computed from the sequence {% cite gottesman1997stabilizer %}. The final unitary $$P$$ is a uniformely random Pauli gate.
- The success metric is the probability of observing the Identity. It is estimated for different lengths $$l$$ and used to fit the exponential decay function.

## Limitations
- Each gate of the Clifford group $$C_n$$ has an implementation cost of $$O(n^2 / \log(n))$$ single and two qubit gates
- Strongly dependent on the compilation step
