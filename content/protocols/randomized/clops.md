# CLOPS Protocol

The Circuit Layer Operations Per Second (CLOPS) {% cite wack2021qualityspeedscalekey %} is a speed benchmark introduced by the IBM company in 2021. This metric is motivated by having a single metric measuring the quality, speed and size of a quantum circuit that can be reliably run on a gate-based quantum computer. This metric permits to measure the number of Quantum Volume (QV) circuits {% cite cross2019validating %} that can be run on a quantum computer per unit of time.
